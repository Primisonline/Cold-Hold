        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Riley K., I'm a reverse transfer student from NIU. I'm here to pick up new skills for my future in IT. Even though I am gravitating towards a more hardware-based role, I know that having skills in the programming scene can be useful. Some of my hobbies are reading, gaming, writing, and building PCs.</p>
